Use this to quickstart flask apps. You can copy or here are my steps.

Set up a virtual environment:
`python -m venv .venv`

Activate using
`source .venv/Scripts/activate`

Grab what you need to start (Flask and python-dotenv)
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Create source folder, static (CSS), templates (HMTL)

Create __init__.py
```
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)
```

Create env files

`.flaskenv` is used to set your flask environment and call the flask app. 
**Note I put the code into a source folder, therefore you have to have an __init__.py file. Then all you have to do in `.flaskenv` is call the folder.** 
```
FLASK_APP=source
FLASK_ENV=development
```

pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
.python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
#   https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control
#poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#pdm.lock
#   pdm stores project-wide configurations in .pdm.toml, but it is recommended to not include it
#   in version control.
